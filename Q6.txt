6.	Which Sql Query is faster? Why? (Discuss)
a.	SELECT * FROM SomeTable Where Date >= ‘2011-01-01’ AND Date < ‘2012-01-01’
b.	SELECT * FROM SomeTable Where DATEPART(yy, Date) = 2011

b. is slower because of the function call in the WHERE clause. This has at least two importan impacts:

1) in b. the function (DATEPART in this case) must be called for each record, in a. the filter is applied directly to the column value
2) using an index for the Data column would be effective in a. but in b. the index couldn't be used.
